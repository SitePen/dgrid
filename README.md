This project provides widgets for lists of data, including simple sets of scrolling rows,
grids of data, on-demand lazy-loaded data, and various plugins for additional functionality. 
This project also provides touch scrolling for mobile devices with native style
momentum, bouncing, and scrollbars.

The dgrid project is available under the same dual BSD/AFLv2 license as the Dojo Toolkit.

# Installation

## Automatic Download with CPM

dgrid can be installed via [CPM](https://github.com/kriszyp/cpm)
using the following command:

    cpm install dgrid

## Manual Download

Alternatively, dgrid and its dependencies can be downloaded individually:

* [xstyle](https://github.com/kriszyp/xstyle)
* [put-selector](https://github.com/kriszyp/put-selector)
* [The Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org) SDK version 1.7
    * Out of the DTK components, Dojo core is the only hard dependency for dgrid;
      however, some of the test pages also use components from Dijit, and
      Dojox (namely grid for a comparison test, and mobile for a mobile page).

It is recommended to arrange all dependencies as siblings, resulting in a
directory structure like the following:

* `dgrid`
* `dijit` (optional, dependency of some dgrid tests)
* `dojo`
* `dojox` (optional, dependency of some dgrid tests)
* `put-selector`
* `xstyle`
* `util` (optional, e.g. if pursuing a custom build)

dgrid v0.2.0 requires at least Dojo 1.7 RC2.  As of this writing,
[Dojo 1.7.1](http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.7.1/) is highly
recommended.

# Components

dgrid's primary components fall into the following top-level modules.

Further information on these modules may be available via the API viewer,
accessible via `doc/api.html` in the downloaded package.

## List

This provides the basic facilities for taking an array of objects and rendering as rows
of HTML in a scrollable area. This will automatically include touch scrolling capabilities
(via the `TouchScroll` module) on mobile devices.

The List can be used to render an array of data. For example:

    define(["dgrid/List"], function(List){
        // attach to a DOM id
        var list = new List({}, "list");
        // render some data
        list.renderArray(arrayOfData);
        ...
    });

### More List APIs

The base List class (inherited by all other classes) also has the following methods:

* `row(target)`: This will look up the requested row and return a Row object.
  The single parameter may be a DOM event, DOM node, data object id, or data object.
  The returned Row object has the following properties:
    * `id`: The data object's id
    * `element`: The row's DOM element
    * `data`: The data object represented by the row
* `on(event, listener)`: Basic event listener functionality;
  simply delegates to the top-level DOM element of the List, using standard `dojo/on` behavior.
* `renderArray(array, beforeNode)`: This can be called to render an array.
  The `beforeNode` parameter can be used to render at a specific place in the List.
* `renderRow(value, options)`: This can be overridden to provide
  custom rendering logic for rows.
* `sort(property, descending)`: This can be called to sort the List by a given
  property; if the second parameter is passed `true`, the sort will be in descending order.
  The Grid and OnDemandList modules further extend this functionality.

## Grid

Grid extends List to provide tabular display of data in columns.
The columns of the grid are typically defined via the `columns` property.
This property can be a hash (object) or array, containing column definition objects.
When `columns` is an object, each property's key is used as the id of the column, and
each value is the column definition object. When `columns` is an array,
the numeric indices become the column IDs.

For example, we could create a grid like so:

    define(["dgrid/Grid"], function(List){
        var grid = new Grid({
            columns: {
                first: {
                    label: "First Name"
                },
                last: {
                    label: "Last Name"
                },
                age: {
                    get: function(index, object){
                        return (new Date().getTime() - object.birthDate.getTime()) / 31536000000;
                    }
                }
            }
        }, "grid"); // attach to a DOM id 
        // render some data
        grid.renderArray(arrayOfData);
        ...
    });

The column definition object may have the following properties (all are optional):

* `field`: This is the property from the object in the list to display in the body of the grid. 
  Defaults to the id of the column (if no `get()` function is provided).
* `label`: This is the label to show in the header of the grid.
  Defaults to the id of the column.
* `className` - A DOM/CSS class to assign to the cells in the column. 
* `id` - This is the id of the column; normally this is determined automatically
  from the keys or indices in the `columns` object or array.
* `sortable`: This indicates whether or not you can sort on this column/field.
  Defaults to `true`.
    * Note that you can always programmatically sort a Grid by a given column using the
      `sort(property, descending)` method, regardless of whether that column's `sortable` status
      or even presence in the Grid altogether.
* `get`: This can be a function that will retrieve the value to render from the object in the list.
* `formatter`: This can be a function that will convert the value to an HTML string for rendering.
* `renderCell`: This can be a function that will be called to render the value into the target &lt;td> for each cell.
  (If `formatter` is specified, `renderCell` is ignored.)
* `renderHeaderCell` - This can be a function that will be called to render the value into the target &lt;th> for the columns header.

Alternatively, the column definition may simply be a string, in which case
the value of the string is interpreted as the label of the column.
Thus, we can more succinctly write simple columns:

    var grid = new Grid({
        columns: {
            first: "First Name",
            last: "Last Name",
            ...
        },
        ...
    }, ...);

Note that the Grid component also supports structures with multiple "sub-rows";
that is, it supports the idea of rendering multiple rows for each item.
Specification of multiple subrows is very much like specifying columns, except
that one uses the `subRows` property instead of `columns`, and it receives an
array of columns objects/arrays.

Both the `columns` and `subRows` properties have respective setters,
`setColumns` and `setSubRows`, which allow resetting the structure of the Grid
at a later time.

By default, the Grid renders a header, containing cells which display the
label of each column.  This can be disabled by setting `showHeader: false`
in the arguments object to the Grid; it can also be changed later using the
`setShowHeader` method.

### Specifying Columns via HTML: GridFromHtml

Some developers prefer specifying column layouts in an actual table structure
because it is more convenient or semantically clearer.  dgrid supports this
via the GridFromHtml module.  When using this module, a `table` element should
be specified as the source node for the grid instance; it then scans for `th`
nodes within rows (typically placed inside the `thead`) to determine columns.

Column properties are specified within the `th`, primarily via the
`data-dgrid-column` attribute, which should contain a JavaScript object.
Properties which coincide with standard HTML attributes can also be specified
as such, e.g. `class`, `rowspan`, and `colspan`.  The innerHTML of the `th` is
interpreted as the column's `label` by default.

Note that *unlike* `data-dojo-props`, `data-dgrid-column` requires that you
include the surrounding curly braces around the object - this allows
alternatively specifying a column plugin instead of just a straight-up object.
(Note, however, that referencing column plugins requires that they be exposed
in the global scope, perhaps under a namespace.)

Examples of creating grids from HTML can be found in the
`GridFromHtml.html` and `complex_columns.html` test pages.

It is also possible to specify columnsets (for the `ColumnSet` module) via
HTML tables by using the `GridWithColumnSetsFromHtml` module.  ColumnSets are
expressed in HTML via `colgroup` tags.  See the `complex_columns.html` test
page for an example of this as well.

### Grid Styling

dgrid components are designed to be highly CSS-driven for optimal performance and organization,
so visual styling should be controlled through CSS. The Grid creates classes
based on the column ids and field names with the convention of
`column-<column-id>` and `field-<field-name>`.
(If a `className` is specified in the column definition, it is used in place of
`field-<field-name>`.)

For example, you could define a grid and CSS like so:

    <style>
    .column-age {
        width: 80px;
    }
    .column-first {
        font-weight: bold;
    }
    </style>
    <script>
    define(["dgrid/Grid"], function(Grid){
        var grid = new Grid({
                columns: { // define the columns
                    age: "Age",
                    first: "First Name",
                    ...
                }}, ...);
        grid.renderArray(someData);
        ...
    });
    </script>

The Grid class also provides a `styleColumn(colId, css)` method to programmatically
add styles to a column, by injecting a rule into a stylesheet in the document.
This method returns a handle with a `remove` function, which can be called to
later remove the style rule that was added.

## OnDemandList

OnDemandList extends List to provide on-demand lazy loading or paging of data as the user
scrolls through the list, and interacts with a
[Dojo object store](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojo/store.html) for
querying of data. This provides a seamless, intuitive interface for viewing
large sets of data in scalable manner. This also provides sorting delegation to the store.

OnDemandList requires that a store be specified via the `store` property,
and will call the `query()` method on the store to retrieve the data to be rendered.
OnDemandList can `query()` with start and count properties so as to only retrieve
the necessary objects needed to render the visible rows. As the list or grid is
scrolled, more `query()` calls will be made to retrieve additional rows,
and previous rows will be pruned from the DOM as they are scrolled well out of view.

For best results, the specified store should return query results with an `observe`
method, which enables the list to keep its display up to date with any changes
that occur in the store after the items are rendered.
The [`dojo/store/Observable`](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojo/store/Observable.html)
module can prove useful for adding this functionality.

The given store should also support the `get` and `getIdentity` functions.

OnDemandList provides the following properties/methods:

* `renderQuery(query)`: Renders the given query into the list.
* `sort(property, descending)`: OnDemandList's version of this method
  defers sorting to the store.
* `sortOrder`: Initially managed by List's `sort()` method,
  this stores the current sort order.
* `save()`: Instructs the list to relay any dirty data (e.g. populated by
  instances of the Editor column plugin) back to the store.  Returns a promise
  which resolves when all necessary put operations have completed successfully
  (even if the store operates synchronously).
* `getBeforePut`: if true (the default), any `save` operations will re-fetch
  the item from the store via a `get` call, before applying changes represented by
  dirty data.
* `setQuery(query, queryOptions)`: Allows specifying a new `query` object
  (and optionally, also `queryOptions`) that the list will use when
  issuing queries to the store.
* `setStore(store, query, queryOptions)`: Allows specifying a new store
  (and optionally, also `query` and `queryOptions`) for the list to reference.

## OnDemandGrid

This module is simply the composition of Grid and OnDemandList.
For example:

    define(["dgrid/OnDemandGrid"], function(Grid){
        grid = new Grid({
                store: myStore, // a Dojo object store
                columns: [ // define the columns
                    {label: "Column 1", field: "col1", editable: true, sortable: true},
                    {label: "Column 2", field: "col2"},
                    ...
                ]
            }, "grid");
        ...
    });

# Plugins

The following modules can be used as plugins to add extra functionality to a Grid.
To use these, simply add the module as a mixin in a `dojo.declare` inheritance chain.
For example, to create a grid based on OnDemandGrid with the
Selection and Keyboard handling plugins, we could do the following:

    define(["dojo", "dgrid/OnDemandGrid", "dgrid/Selection", "dgrid/Keyboard"], function(dojo, Grid, Selection, Keyboard){
        // create a grid based on plugins
        var MyGrid = dojo.declare([Grid, Selection, Keyboard]);
        // instantiate it
        var grid = new MyGrid({
            store: myStore,
            ...
        }, "grid");
        ...
    });

You can also perform inline mixin and instantiation:

    var grid = new (dojo.declare([Grid, Selection, Keyboard]))({
        store: myStore,
        ...
    }, "grid");

Below is a synopsis of available plugins.

## ColumnSet

The ColumnSet module provides functionality which divides a Grid's columns into
multiple distinct sets, each of which manage their columns' horizontal scrolling
independently.  This makes it possible to keep certain columns in view even while
others are scrolled out of viewing range.

When mixing in ColumnSet, instead of specifying `columns` or `subRows`, one
specifies `columnSets`, which is essentially an array of `subRows`.  For example,
in pseudocode:

    var grid = new (dojo.declare([Grid, ColumnSet]))({
        columnSets: [
            // left columnset
            [
                [
                    { /* columnset 1, subrow 1, column 1 */ },
                    { /* columnset 1, subrow 1, column 2 */ }
                ],
                [
                    { /* columnset 1, subrow 2, column 1 */ },
                    { /* columnset 1, subrow 2, column 2 */ }
                ]
            ],
            // right columnset
            [
                [
                    { /* columnset 2, subrow 1, column 1 */ },
                    { /* columnset 2, subrow 1, column 2 */ }
                ],
                [
                    { /* columnset 2, subrow 2, column 1 */ },
                    { /* columnset 2, subrow 2, column 2 */ }
                ]
            ]
        ],
        ...
    }, "grid");

More concrete examples can be found in the `complex_column.html` test page.

## Selection

Adds selection capability to a List/Grid. The list instance will include a
`selection` property representing the selected items.  This plugin will also
fire `dgrid-select` and `dgrid-deselect` events. For example:

    grid = dojo.declare([Grid, Selection])({
        selectionMode: "single",
        ...});
    grid.on("dgrid-select", function(event){
        // get the row that was just selected
        var row = grid.row(event);
        for(var id in grid.selection){
            if(grid.selection[id] === true){
                // iterate through all selected items
            }
        }
    });
    grid.on("dgrid-deselect", function(event){
        var row = grid.row(event);
        // row was just deselected 
    });

The following properties and methods are added by the Selection plugin:

* `selection`: The object containing the ids of the selected objects.
* `selectionMode`: A string indicating the mode of selection.
  The following values are acceptable:
    * `extended`: The default setting; follows common ctrl and shift key practices for selection
    * `single`: Only allows one row to be selected at a time
    * `multiple`: Similar to `extended`,
      but normal clicks add selection without removing previous selections
    * `none`: Nothing can be selected by user interaction;
      only programmatic selection (or selection via selectors) is allowed
* `select(id)`: Programmatically select a row
* `deselect(id)`: Programmatically deselect a row

The `select` and `deselect` methods can be passed an object id, or anything else
acceptable by List's `row` method.

### CellSelection

The CellSelection plugin extends upon the functionality of the Selection plugin
to provide celection at the cell level.

Whereas Selection's `select` and `deselect` methods look up the passed argument
via List's `row` method, CellSelection looks it up via Grid's `cell` method.

## Keyboard

This plugin adds keyboard handling functionality.
The arrow keys can be used to navigate the focus across cells and rows,
providing accessibility and ease of use.

When used with grids, this plugin references the `cellNavigation` property of
the grid instance, to determine whether keyboard navigation and focus should
operate at the individual cell level (`true`, the default) or at the row level
(`false`).

# Column Plugins

The following modules are plugins designed for specific columns of a Grid.
These plugins are used by creating an instance and specifying it as a column in
`columns` (or `subRows`).

For example, to create a column structure where the first column has a
tree expander and the second column has a checkbox, we could do this:

    define(["dgrid/OnDemandGrid", "dgrid/Tree", "dgrid/Editor"], function(Grid, Tree, Editor){
        grid = new Grid({
                store: myHierarchicalStore, // a Dojo object store
                columns: [ // define the columns
                    // first column will have a tree expander:
                    Tree({label: "Name", field: "name"}),
                    // second column will render with a checkbox: 
                    Editor({label: "A CheckBox", field: "bool"}, "checkbox"),
                    // just a normal column:
                    {label: "Type", field: "type"},
                    ...
                ]
            }, "grid");
        ...
    });

## Tree

The Tree plugin enables expansion of rows to display children.
It expects to operate on an OnDemandGrid, whose store is expected to provide
a `getChildren(object, options)` method to return the children for each object.
Note that for best results, `getChildren` should return results with an `observe`
function as well, so that changes to children can also be reflected as they occur.

The store may also (optionally) provide a `mayHaveChildren(object)` method
which returns a boolean indicating whether or not the row can be expanded.

## Editor

The Editor plugin provides the ability to render editor controls within cells
for a column.  When used in conjunction with the OnDemandGrid module, edited
fields are directly correlated with the dirty state of the grid;
changes can then be saved back to the store based on edits performed in the grid.

The Editor module supports both standard HTML input elements and widgets.
To create an Editor which uses a simple input element, simply specify the type
of the input element as the second parameter.  For example, the following would
result in an Editor which presents a text field for each value in the column:

    Editor({/* column definition here */}, "text")

To create an Editor which uses a widget, pass the widget constructor as the
second parameter.  For example:

    Editor({/* column definition here */}, TextBox)

Additionally, arguments can be passed to the widget constructor by specifying a
`widgetArgs` property in the column definition.  `widgetArgs` may be a
simple object, but it can also be a function, for cases where widget
initialization parameters may depend on context.  In the latter case,
the function will be passed the data object for the current row,
and should return an args object which will be passed to the widget constructor.

By default, Editors will always be active.  However, a third argument may be
specified to the Editor function, which indicates which event (or events,
comma-delimited) should switch the cell into edit mode.  In this case, the
cell's data will display as normal until that event is fired, at which point
the editor will be rendered, replacing the cell's content.  When the editor
loses focus, it will disappear, replaced by the updated content.

**Please note:** if attempting to trigger an Editor on focus (to accommodate
keyboard and mouse), it is highly recommended to use dgrid's custom event,
`dgrid-cellfocusin` instead of `focus`, to avoid confusion of events.  Note
that this requires also mixing the Keyboard module into the Grid.

By default, changes made to items via Editors do not immediately propagate to
the store.  However, this can be enabled for a particular Editor by
specifying `autoSave: true` in the column definition.

For examples of Editor in use, see the `editor.html` and `editor2.html` test pages.

# Extensions

The following are additional plugins which dwell outside dgrid's core feature set.
Extensions live in the `extensions` subdirectory; their tests and
css/image resources also live under respective `css/extensions` and
`test/extensions` subdirectories.

## ColumnResizer

The ColumnResizer plugin can be used to add column resizing functionality
(accessible via mouse drag).  Originally based on
[the gridx ColumnResizer module](https://github.com/evanhw/gridx/blob/master/gridx/modules/ColumnResizer.js),
the plugin has been further developed for better performance and integration with dgrid.

## DnD

The DnD plugin can be used to add row drag'n'drop functionality.

### Requirements

The DnD module assumes usage of the OnDemandList or OnDemandGrid module; thus, it
expects a store to be in use.

The store should be order-aware, supporting the `options.before` parameter
on `add()` and `put()` calls to properly respond to DnD operations.

Additionally, if the store supports a `copy` method, it will be called for
DnD copy operations within the same list/grid (since a `put` would normally
relocate the item).

# Themes/Skins

dgrid automatically loads the necessary structural CSS to work properly.
However, to make the component far more visually attractive and interesting,
it is common to also apply one of the the included skins. There are various CSS
files under the `css/skins` directory which can be used to skin the dgrid to a
particular look and feel.

## Grid Structure for custom CSS Styling

dgrid's appearance is designed to be styled and customized via CSS.
Many of the classes involved can be discovered by simply looking at elements in
your browser developer tools of choice.
Perhaps the most important classes are the `column-<id>` and `field-<fieldname>`
classes assigned to each cell in grids, which allow for per-column styling.

The following class names are used by dgrid and can be referenced from CSS:

* `dgrid`: Applied to each dgrid list or grid at the top-level element
* `dgrid-header`: Applied to the element which contains the header area
* `dgrid-scroller`: Applied to the element responsible for scrolling the data content
* `dgrid-content`: Applied to the element inside of the scroller area,
  which holds all the data contents
* `dgrid-row`: Applied to each row element
* `dgrid-row-even`: Applied to each even row element
* `dgrid-row-odd`: Applied to each odd row element
  Applying a different color to alternating rows can help visually distinguish individual items.
* `dgrid-selected`: Applied to selected rows or cells
* `dgrid-cell`: Applied to each cell element
* `dgrid-cell-padding`: Applied to each cell element, or to an
  inner element within the cell in older versions of non-quirks mode IE to
  properly apply padding to keep the padding within the box measurements
  (box-sizing is preferred by the grid).
* `dgrid-focus`: Applied to the element (cell or row) with the focus (for keyboard based navigation)
* `dgrid-expando-icon`: Applied to the expando icon on tree nodes
* `dgrid-header-scroll`: Applied to the node in the top right corner of a Grid,
  above the vertical scrollbar

The following generic class names are also available for generic skinning
(following the jQuery ThemeRoller convention):

* `ui-widget-content`: Applied to each dgrid list or grid at the top element
* `ui-widget-header`: Applied to the element that contains the header rendering
* `ui-state-default`: Applied to each row element
* `ui-state-active`: Applied to selected rows or cells
* `ui-state-highlight`: Applied to a row for a short time when the contents are change (or it is newly created)
