<h3>About</h3>
<p>
	This page demonstrates presenting several different views within a single
	Grid instance, by swapping out the <code>renderRow</code> function.
	The details and gallery views also demonstrate switching the grid header
	off by calling <code>setShowHeader</code>.
	(In fact, if only the Details and Gallery views were desired,
	the <code>List</code> module would be sufficient.)

	In addition, the "table" view demonstrates hooking up a click callback,
	in order to display more information when a row is clicked.
