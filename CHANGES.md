# master (0.3.6-dev)

## Breaking changes

### OnDemandList's dgrid-refresh-complete event no longer includes rows

The `rows` property of this event was removed to match the implementation
added to the Pagination extension, which does not include it.  If a particular
row is needed, it can be resolved from the QueryResults included on the event
via `grid.row(...).element`.

## Significant changes

### General/Core

* Added an index page to the test folder to browse the tests via a grid. (#407)
* Added a preliminary set of DOH tests to assist in spotting regressions. (#412)

### Mixins

* The `Keyboard` mixin has been made significantly more extensible (#429):
  * Added `keyMap` and `headerKeyMap` properties, which are object hashes
    whose keys are event key codes and whose values are functions to be
    executed in the context of the instance; if not specified, defaults
    (exposed via `Keyboard.defaultKeyMap` and `keyboard.defaultHeaderKeyMap`)
    will be used.
  * Added `addKeyHandler(key, callback, isHeader)` method for registering
    additional keyboard handlers; this is usually easier than trying to
    override `keyMap` or `headerKeyMap`.
* The `Keyboard` mixin no longer emits `dgrid-cellfocusout` and
  `dgrid-cellfocusin` when spacebar is pressed. (#429)

### Column Plugins

* The `editor` column plugin now emits `dgrid-editor-show` and `dgrid-editor-hide`
  events when an editor with `editOn` set is shown or hidden, respectively. (#424)

### Extensions

* The `Pagination` extension now emits `dgrid-refresh-complete` like
  `OnDemandList`.  (#188, #411)

## Other changes and fixes

### General/Core

* Fixed `Grid#styleColumn`, which had broken in 0.3.5. (#408)
* Fixed an issue with `Grid#cell` specific to when a cell object representing a
  header cell was passed in. (#429)
* The `Keyboard` mixin now properly handles Home/End keypresses.
* Fixed logic in `_StoreMixin` to work around a
  [Dojo 1.8 bug with `when`](http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/16667), which
  could inappropriately mutate the return value of `_trackError`. (#411)
* Fixed logic in `OnDemandList` so that asynchronous errors during `refresh`
  are properly signaled via the promise it returns. (#411)
* Added CSS to ensure that IE6 renders empty `OnDemandList` preload nodes with
  0 height. (#429)

### Column Plugins

* The `editor` plugin now supports widgets returning object values by comparing
  using `valueOf`. (#256, #304, #423)
* The `tree` plugin has been refactored to make use of the `util/has-css3`
  module, rather than feature-detecting upon first expansion. (#416)

# 0.3.5

## Breaking changes

### Signature of the newRow method

The `newRow` method in List, called in reaction to observed store changes,
has had its signature altered to match that of `insertRow`.  Please note
that it is likely that `newRow` may be refactored out of existence in the future.

### Grid and the columns property

The `Grid` module now normalizes the `columns` instance property to an object
even when it is passed in as an array. This means that any code written
which accesses `grid.columns` directly will break if it expects it to maintain
the array structure that was originally passed in.

To compensate for this, `get("columns")` retains the previous behavior - it
returns `columns` as initially passed, except in the case where `subRows` is
passed instead, in which case it returns an object hash version of the structure
keyed by column IDs.

### put-selector version

When updating to dgrid 0.3.5, make sure you also update your version of
[put-selector](https://github.com/kriszyp/put-selector) to 0.3.1 or higher
(0.3.2 is the latest at the time of this writing).  If you use
[cpm](https://github.com/kriszyp/cpm) to update dgrid, this should happen
automatically.

## Significant changes

### General/Core

* `List` instances will now clean up any styles added dynamically via the
    `addCssRule` method; this also applies by extension to `Grid#styleColumn`
    and `ColumnSet#styleColumnSet`.  This may cause a change in behavior in some
    edge cases; the previous behavior can be obtained by passing
    `cleanAddedRules: false` in the constructor arguments object. (#371)
* The `up` and `down` methods of `List` will now call `grid.row` internally to
    resolve whatever argument is passed; the `left` and `right` methods of
    `Grid` will call `grid.cell`.  (Formerly these methods only accepted a
    row or cell object directly.)
* The `Grid` module now ensures that an object hash of the grid's columns is
    always available (see Breaking Changes above); this fixes issues when
    column IDs are explicitly set, but then couldn't be properly looked up
    against the `columns` array.
* The `Grid` module now emits a `dgrid-sort` event when a sortable header cell
    is clicked; this event includes a `sort` property, and may be canceled to
    stop the sort, or to substitute alternative behavior.  In the latter case,
    if updating the sort arrow in the UI is still desired, call the
    `updateSortArrow` method and pass the `sort` value from the event.
* The `OnDemandList` module now supports a `pagingMethod` property, which allows
    specifying whether to throttle or debounce scroll events.  The default
    behavior has been changed from `"throttleDelayed"` to `"debounce"`, which
    generally is capable of far reducing the number of store queries issued,
    moreso if `pagingDelay` is increased (though its default remains the same).
* The `OnDemandList` module now supports a `keepScrollPosition` property, which
    will attempt to preserve scroll position between refresh calls.  This can be
    set on the instance itself to affect all refreshes, or can be passed to the
    `refresh` method directly for a specific call.
* The `OnDemandList` module now returns a promise from the `refresh` method,
    which resolves when the grid finishes rendering results after the refresh.
    It also emits a `dgrid-refresh-complete` event, which includes both a
    reference to the QueryResults object (`results`) and the rendered rows
    (`rows`).  In addition, the `dgrid-error` event now fires more consistently
    (both for `OnDemandList` and `Pagination`).

### Mixins

* The `Selection` mixin now supports an `allowTextSelection` property, allowing
    text selection within a List or Grid to be permitted or denied completely
    independently from the `selectionMode` property; default behavior is still
    to prevent unless `selectionMode` is `none`.  Selection prevention itself
    has also been fixed to work in all browsers. (#148)

### Column Plugins

* Fixed a `tree` regression since 0.3.2 involving only-child rows being misplaced
    upon observed changes. (#353)

### Extensions

* The `ColumnResizer` extension now supports an `adjustLastColumn` flag; when
    set to `true` (the default, and previous behavior), this will adjust the
    last column's width to `auto` at times where a column resize operation would
    otherwise cause column widths to stretch due to how browsers render tables.
    This can be set to `false` to purposely disable this behavior.
* The `Pagination` extension now returns a promise from the `refresh` and
    `gotoPage` methods, which resolves when the grid finishes rendering results.
    Note that it does not (yet) emit an event like `OnDemandList`.
* The `Pagination` extension now re-queries for the current page of data when
    the grid is notified of a store modification which affects the number of
    items currently rendered. (#283)
* The `Pagination` extension now supports a `showLoadingMessage` property; by
    default (`true`), a loading node will be displayed whenever a new page is
    requested; if set to `false`, the grid will instead retain the previous
    content until the new data is fully received and ready to render. (#219)
* The `Pagination` extension now includes localized strings for the following languages:
    * French (#381, thanks mduriancik)
    * Brazilian Portuguese (#376, thanks stavarengo)
    * Slovak (#381, thanks mduriancik)
* The `DijitRegistry` extension now supports dgrid components as direct children
    of common Dijit layout container widgets, and will now properly alter the
    size of a list or grid if the `resize` method is passed an argument. (#401)

## Other changes and fixes

### General/Core

* Resolved an issue where upon changing column structure, the placement of the
    sort arrow would be lost even though the grid is still sorting by the same
    field.
* Simplified logic in `Grid` to always create `tr` elements. (#387)
* Resolved an issue where `OnDemandList` could end up firing requests where
    start exceeds total and count is negative. (#323)
* Resolved issues regarding proper handling of errors / rejected promises in
    `OnDemandList` as well as the `Pagination` extension.
    (#351; obsoletes #241, #242)
* Resolved potential memory leaks in `Grid`, `ColumnSet`, and `ColumnResizer`.
    (#393, #394, #395, #396, #397)
* Resolved issues in `Grid`, `ColumnSet`, `ColumnHider`, and `ColumnResizer`
    regarding dynamic style injection for grids with DOM node IDs containing
    unsafe characters; added `escapeCssIdentifier` function to `util/misc`. (#402)
* Resolved an issue in `TouchScroll` which unnecessarily prevented native
    touch-scrolling even when the component can't be scrolled. (#344)

### Mixins

* Resolved an issue with the `ColumnSet` mixin where clicking within the
    horizontal scrollbar area (aside from the arrows/handle) wouldn't work in IE.
    (#307)
* Improved logic of `isSelect` for `Selection` and `CellSelection` regarding
    unloaded rows/cells in combination with the select-all feature in some cases.
    (#258)

### Extensions

* Resolved an issue where `ColumnHider` would leave styles applied for hiding
    columns, which could have adverse effects if a new grid is later created
    with the same ID. (#371)
* Resolved an issue with `ColumnHider` which could cause the hidden state of
    columns to be forgotten when other components such as `ColumnReorder`
    interact with the column structure. (#289)
* Resolved an issue with `ColumnHider` related to IE8 standards mode's handling
    of `display: none` cells. (#362)
* Resolved an issue where widths set via the `ColumnResizer` extension would be
    reset upon rearranging columns with the `ColumnReorder` extension.
* Resolved an issue in `ColumnResizer` styles which caused body and header cells
    to skew in Chrome 19 and Safari 6. (#142, #370)
* Changed name of private `_columnStyles` object used by the `ColumnResizer`
    extension to `_columnSizes` to reduce ambiguity.
* The `Pagination` extension will no longer immediately throw errors if it is
    initialized without a store.  However, a warning will be logged, and any
    method calls will likely throw errors until a store is assigned. (#355)

# 0.3.4

## Significant changes

### Extensions

* The `ColumnResizer` extension now emits a `dgrid-columnresize` event when a resize
    occurs; if initiated by the user, the event will include a `parentType` property
    indicating the type of event that triggered it.  If this event is canceled,
    the column will not be resized. (#320)
* The `ColumnResizer` extension now honors a `width` property included on column
    definition objects for the purpose of initializing the width of a column; this
    can be useful if it is desired to persist and restore custom column widths
    from a cookie or other local storage. (#321)
* The `ColumnResizer` extension now honors a `resizable` property included on
    column definition objects for the purpose of disallowing resize of specific
    columns. (#325)

## Other changes and fixes

### General/Core

* Resolved an issue in `List` relating to scrolling and preload nodes. (#318, #323)

### Mixins

* The `ColumnSet` mixin now supports horizontal mousewheel events. (#239)

### Column Plugins

* The column plugins (`editor`, `selector`, and `tree`) can now be invoked without
    a column definition object at all, if no properties need to be set.  This
    is mostly useful for `selector`. (#324)
* Fixed an issue with the `selector` plugin when a column definition lacks a
    `label` property. (#324)
* Always-on `editor` columns now honor the `canEdit` function on column definitions
    at the time each cell is rendered.
* Always-on `editor` columns now properly revert values if the `dgrid-datachange`
    event is canceled. (#252)

### Extensions

* The `ColumnResizer` extension's resize indicator now follows the cursor
    even when dragging beyond the grid's boundaries, and reacts if the mouse
    button is released even outside the boundaries of the browser window. (#310)

# 0.3.3

## Breaking changes

* The `Keyboard` module's `dgrid-cellfocusin` and `dgrid-cellfocusout` events
    now report either a `row` or `cell` object, depending on whether
    `cellNavigation` is `false` or `true`, respectively.  (Formerly these events
    always contained a `cell` property pointing to the DOM node that fired the event.)
* Several mixin and extension modules have had their `declare` hierarchies
    simplified under the expectation that they will always be mixed in as
    documented, and never be instantiated directly.  To be clear, this will not
    break any code that is written as prescribed by the documentation.

## Significant changes

* All custom events fired by dgrid components now report the following properties:
    * `grid`: The dgrid instance which fired the event.
    * `parentType`: If the event was fired in direct response to another event,
        this property reflects the type of the originating event.  If the event
        was fired due to a direct API call, `parentType` will not be defined.
* The `ColumnReorder` extension now fires a `dgrid-columnreorder` event when
    a column is reordered via drag'n'drop.  Note that this event always reports
    a `parentType` of `"dnd"` (there is no way to trigger this event directly
    from an API call).
* The `Pagination` extension now exposes and references its i18n strings via the
    `i18nPagination` instance property, allowing these strings to be overridden.
    (#225)

## Other changes and fixes

### General/Core

* Fixed an issue with the `up` and `down` methods in `List` and the `left` and
    `right` methods in `Grid`, which could cause them to attempt to traverse
    outside the list/grid in question.
* Fixed an issue in the observer code in `List` which could cause an updated
    row to render out-of-sequence when `tree` is used. (#154)
* Fixed an issue that could cause old IE to throw errors due to an undefined
    parameter to `insertBefore`. (#308)
* The `_StoreMixin` module now shows/hides a node displaying `noDataMessage` in
    reaction to the last row being removed or first row being added. (#229)
* The `OnDemandList` module now adheres more strictly to the `maxRowsPerPage`
    property.  To accommodate this, the default has been increased from `100` to
    `250`. (#280)
* The `OnDemandList` module's default value for `farOffRemoval` has been
    lowered from `10000` to `2000`.
* The `loadingMessage` property (referenced by `OnDemandList` and the `Pagination`
    extension) now supports HTML strings, like `noDataMessage` (#312)
* The CSS for one of the `util/has-css3` module's tests has had its class renamed
    to prevent conflicting with users of Modernizr. (#313)

### Mixins

* The `Selection` mixin in single-selection mode now properly allows reselecting
    a row that was deselected immediately prior. (#295)

### Extensions

* The `ColumnHider` extension will now resize its popup element and enable
    scrolling within it, in cases where its height would otherwise exceed the
    that of the parent grid. (#311)
* The `Pagination` extension now supports `noDataMessage` like `OnDemandList`. (#180)

# 0.3.2

## Breaking changes

### GridFromHtml and OnDemandGrid

The `GridFromHtml` module no longer automatically mixes in the `OnDemandGrid`
module, mixing in only `Grid` instead, in order to support the option of using
alternative store-backed mechanisms such as the `Pagination` extension.
This may cause existing code which relied on `GridFromHtml` and loaded from a
store to break.  Such cases will now need to mix in `OnDemandList` manually
(they don't need to mix in `OnDemandGrid`, since `Grid` is still inherited by
`GridFromHtml`).

There are a couple of ways to deal with this.  In Dojo 1.8, when parsing dgrid
instances declaratively, the new `data-dojo-mixins` attribute can be used to
mix `OnDemandList` into `GridFromHtml`:

```html
<table data-dojo-type="dgrid/GridFromHtml" data-dojo-mixins="dgrid/OnDemandList" data-dojo-props="...">
    ...
</table>
```

In the case of Dojo 1.7, `dojo/parser` doesn't understand module IDs, and so a
global reference to the dgrid components used is needed.  Changing such code to
mix in `OnDemandList` involves nothing more than an additional use of `declare`:

```html
<table data-dojo-type="dgrid.OnDemandGridFromHtml" data-dojo-props="...">
    ...
</table>
...
<script>
    var dgrid = {}; // declared in global scope
    require(["dojo/_base/declare", "dojo/parser", "dgrid/GridFromHtml", "dgrid/OnDemandList", ..., "dojo/domReady!"],
    function(declare, parser, GridFromHtml, OnDemandList, ...) {
        // Create dgrid constructor with necessary components, available in the global scope.
        dgrid.OnDemandGridFromHtml = declare([GridFromHtml, OnDemandList]);
        
        // Parse the document, now that the above constructor is available.
        parser.parse();
    });
</script>
```

## Significant changes

### General/Core

* All dgrid components now have `scrollTo` and `getScrollPosition` methods,
  either inheriting from `TouchScroll` (see below) or implemented in `List`
  based on `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft`.  Updates have been made to dgrid
  components where necessary to leverage these methods.
* All dgrid components now respond to `set("showFooter")` consistently with
  `set("showHeader")`. (#284)
* It is now possible to initialize or later set CSS classes on a dgrid component's
  top DOM node via `"class"` or `className`. (#183)
* `_StoreMixin` (used by `OnDemandList` and the `Pagination` extension) now
  includes a reference to the grid instance in emitted `dgrid-error` events
  (via a `grid` property on the `error` object).
* The `TouchScroll` module has undergone significant changes and improvements:
    * uses CSS3 `translate3d` to take advantage of hardware acceleration
        * a `util/has-css3` module has been added with has-feature tests to
          detect CSS3 features to be used by `TouchScroll`
    * implements increased tension and bounce-back beyond edges
    * displays scrollbars as appropriate while scrolling
    * implements `scrollTo` and `getScrollPosition` methods to allow manipulation
      and retrieval of scroll information based on CSS transformations
    * allows configuring how many touches are necessary to activate scrolling,
      via the `touchesToScroll` property

### Mixins

* The `ColumnSet` mixin now defines a `styleColumnSet` method, which is
  analogous to Grid's `styleColumn` method, but instead adds a style rule for
  the class on nodes containing the entire columnset contents for a row.
* The `Keyboard` mixin now defines `focus` and `focusHeader` methods, for
  programmatically focusing a row or cell (depending on the value of the
  `cellNavigation` setting). (#130)

### Column Plugins

* The `tree` column plugin now supports a `collapseOnRefresh` property in the
  column definition; if set to `true`, it will cause all parent rows to render
  collapsed whenever the grid is refreshed, rather than remembering their
  previous state.
* The `tree` column plugin now supports a `allowDuplicates` property in the
  column definition; this can be set to `true` to allow for cases where the same
  item may appear under multiple parents in the tree.  Note however that it
  limits the capabilities of the `row` method to the top level only. (#147)

### Extensions

* A `CompoundColumns` extension has been added, which allows defining column
  structures which include additional spanning header cells describing the
  contents beneath.
* The `ColumnHider` extension has undergone some refactoring to make it more
  extensible and to provide a public API for toggling the hidden state of a
  column, via the `toggleColumnHiddenState(columnId)` method.
* The `ColumnReorder` extension has been refactored to allow reordering of
  columns within the same subrow or columnset in more complex column structures,
  in addition to the previous ability to reorder columns in simple single-row
  structures.
* The `DnD` extension now properly supports touch devices when used with Dojo 1.8.
* The `DnD` extension now supports specifying a `getObjectDndType` function, for
  customizing the DnD type reported for each item rendered.

## Other changes and fixes

### General/Core

* Several accessibility issues have been addressed, including fixes to the
  roles reported by certain elements, and labels added to the Pagination
  extension's controls. (Partly attributed to #273)
* `Grid`: calls to `cell` with a falsy `columnId` value now work properly. (#198)
* Fixed an issue with dgrid instances not reacting correctly to window resize.
* Fixed an issue affecting odd/even row classes on in-place updates. (#269)
* Fixed a rendering issue involving confusion of preload node dimensions. (#161)
* Fixed an issue causing `tree` level indentation to render improperly when used
  with the `Pagination` extension.
* Fixed a deprecated API call in `_StoreMixin`. (#272)
* Improved logic in `OnDemandList` to properly account for lists with displays
  which tile items using `display: inline-block`.

### Mixins

* The `ColumnSet` mixin now behaves properly when calling
  `set("columnSets", ...)`. (#202)
* The non-standard `colsetid` attribute assigned to nodes by the `ColumnSet`
  mixin has been replaced with the `data-dgrid-column-set-id` attribute.
* The `Selection` mixin will now properly reset `_lastSelected` when
  `clearSelection` is called. (#175)
* The `Selection` mixin will now wait until `mouseup` when handling mouse events
  on targets that are already selected. (#251)

### Column Plugins

* The `expand` method defined by the `tree` column plugin will no longer
  be called at all in reaction to events on rows which report no children.

### Extensions

* The `ColumnHider` extension now supports setting `hidden` and `unhidable`
  together, resulting in the column being hidden and not being present in the
  popup menu (but it can still be shown programmatically). (#199)
* The `ColumnHider` extension now behaves appropriately for columns with no
  `label` defined. (#244)
* A number of protected members in the `ColumnHider` extension have been renamed:
    * `_toggleColumnState` has been replaced by `_setColumnHiddenState` and the
      public API `toggleColumnHiddenState` mentioned above
    * `_toggleHiderMenu` has been renamed to `_toggleColumnHiderMenu`
    * `_columnStyleRules` has been renamed to `_columnHiderRules`
* An issue with the `ColumnResizer` extension which could cause distortion of
  width values on the first resize has been fixed. (#291)
* The `DnD` extension can now drag non-root tree items *in Dojo 1.8 only* by
  passing `allowNested: true` to the source via `dndParams`. (#68)
* The `DnD` extension now behaves better with regard to synchronizing with
  dgrid's `Selection` mixin, and also with regard to dragging when some selected
  nodes are no longer in the DOM. (#185, #246)
* The `DnD` extension now adds CSS to adequately override spurious styles which
  can leak in from dijit.css in Dojo 1.8. (#255)

# 0.3.1

## Significant changes

* Column plugins can now define the following functions on column definitions,
  providing more opportune timing for initialization and tear-down:
    * `init`, which will be executed at the time the grid's column configuration
      is (re-)applied
    * `destroy`, which will be executed when the grid is destroyed, as well as
      before a new column configuration is applied
* The `tree` plugin now supports the following column definition properties:
    * `shouldExpand(row, level, previouslyExpanded)`, a function providing for
      conditional automatic expansion of parent rows (#141)
    * `indentWidth`, an integer specifying the size (in pixels) of each level's
      indent (note that the default is now `9`, though it was previously `19`)
    * `renderExpando()`, a function which can replace the default logic for
      rendering the expando node (the arrow next to the content of each cell)
* The `editor` plugin now augments the grid instance with an `edit(cell)` method
  which can be used to programmatically activate the editor in a given cell.
* A `util/mouse` module has been added, which exposes simulated events for
  the mouse entering and leaving grid rows and cells. (#165)
* A `package.js` has been added in order to streamline the build process.
  `package.json` has been updated to reflect the presence of `package.js` and
  reference the latest versions of xstyle and put-selector, each of which now
  have a `package.js` of their own.

## Other Fixes

* Mouse events for expanding/collapsing rows in tree grids should be a bit more
  reliable. (#112)
* Rows expanded in a tree grid which has been started up but is currently hidden
  will now be rendered properly when re-shown. (#140)
* The `tree` and `editor` plugins can now both be used on the same column, by
  wrapping `editor` with `tree`. (#144)
* `sortable` now defaults to `false` for columns where `field` is `"_item"`
  or entirely unspecified (in which case there's nothing to sort by anyway).
  (#149)
* The `Pagination` extension now behaves appropriately with empty result sets.
  (#173)
* The `ColumnHider` extension now iterates over `subRows` rather than `columns`,
  making it a bit more reliable in general. (#164)
* A couple of issues with the `DijitRegistry` extension were identified and
  fixed. (#146, thanks jdohert)
